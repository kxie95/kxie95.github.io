Hi, my name is Karen.

***

#### I was born and raised in New Zealand (mostly).

Life as a Chiwi (Chinese Kiwi) has been pretty sweet. I love the diversity of New Zealand and the chill'dness of this country. 

Growing up, I definitely had a bit of an identity crisis - was I Chinese? Nope. The people who came fresh off the boat from China were totally different to me. I couldn't really talk to them properly because of my broken Chinese. Was I Kiwi? Not quite either.

Eventually I came to know Jesus, so I can now confidently say I am a child of God. To know the one who knows you intimately is the most life-changing thing ever.  

#### When I discovered programming in university

I still remember the first time I wrote my first piece of code. It was so satisfying! I just wrote a few lines to do some mathematical calculations but it felt so magical. I can write intructions that execute faster than my brain! 

#### Now I'm at crossroads
