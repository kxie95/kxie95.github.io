* Refactoring requires tests.
* Make sure all tests are fully automatic and that they check their own results.
* By writing tests first, you concentrate on the interface rather than implementation and have a clear point at which to stop.
* Run tests frequently.
* It's better to write and run incomplete tests than not to run complete tests.
* Concentrate tests on boundary conditions.
