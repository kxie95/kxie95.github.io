categories: simple design

**Tests pass**  
* Makes sure that the software works as intended.
* No production code should ever be pushed out without verifying that it works. Tests do that.  

**Reveals intention**
* Your code should be easy to understand when read by someone else.
* Naming of variables, methods and classes are meaningful.
* Good layout of code (line breaks where it makes sense, tabbing, etc).  

**No duplication**
* Don't repeat yourself.
* Duplication of intent, not necessarily code.
* Most of the time if you are duplicating code though it's very likely you are duplicating intent.  

**Fewest elements**
* Solution should be concise - anything that doesn't follow the other 3 rules should be removed.
* Write the smallest amount of code to make the tests pass.
