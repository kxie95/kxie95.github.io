Apprenticeship Patterns was a good read, and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone, whether early or late in their career. It's all about cultivating a learning mindset and ways to overcome common problems we have in our programming careers. The great thing about it is that it lists problems that we all face, goes through possible solutions and has an action section at the end.

The first time I read this, it was more of a skim and I enjoyed it. The challenge for me now is to actually do the Action points!

## Emptying The Cup
### Your First Language
Get depth of knowledge instead of just the basics of a knowledge. This will help you write cleaner code.

**Action**  
Find your language's specification and read it.

### Concrete Skills
Know what skills you need to learn to join the teams you want to join.

**Action**  
Collect the CVs of people whose skills you respect. Identify five discrete skills noted on the CV and determine which of these skills would be immediately useful on the kind of team you want to join. Put together a plan and a toy project that will demonstrate that you have acquired these skills.

### Expose Your Ignorance
This is about being aware of your weaknesses - everyone has them.

**Action**  
Write down 5 things you really don't understand about your work. Put that list where others can see it. Refresh it as your work changes.

### Confront your Ignorance
Actively fill in the gaps in your knowledge from "Expose Your Ignorance".

### The Deep End
Sometimes you just have to take on a challenge you think you might not be able to conquer. Whether you produce a good result or not, you will grow from it.

**Action**  
What's the biggest successful project you've worked on? What's the biggest codebase you have ever built on your own? Write down the answers to these questions, and see if you can find other dimensions of project complexity and other ways of measuring your projects. Build up a chart of all projects you've ever worked on.

### Retreat Into Competence
When the deep end gets too tough, temporarily go back into a space you're comfortable with and you may see how far you've actually come.

**Action**
Take some time to build something you know how to build.

## Walking The Long Road
### The Long Road
This is about thinking about the big picture. Make choices that will benefit in the long run, not money.
  
**Action**  
Think about experiences you would want to have tried in 10, 20, 30, 40 year from now. Use this to plan your future career choices.

### Craft over Art
There will always be a constant tension between writing beautiful code and delivering value to the customer. You should be focused on delivering value to the customer rather than advancing your own self-interests.  

**Action**  
Find the opportunity to do something useful rather than beautiful.
