Apprenticeship Patterns was a good read, and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone, whether early or late in their career. It's all about cultivating a learning mindset and ways to overcome common problems we have in our programming careers. The great thing about it is that it lists problems that we all face, goes through possible solutions and has an action section at the end.

The first time I read this, it was more of a skim and I enjoyed it. The challenge for me now is to actually do the Action points!

### You First Language

**Problem**  
You only have a shallow understanding of one or two languages.

**Solution**  
Build something in the language you want to have a deep understanding of. Get a mentor who is experienced in that language. Don't get stuck in this language though - look for opportunities to learn programming languages with a radically different approach to your own.

**Action**  
Find your language's specification and read it.

### Concrete Skills

**Problem**  
This is a challenge you will face eventually - you want to join a team who you can learn from, but you don't have the skills. You know in theory how things work but you've never actually done it.

**Solution**  
Acquire these skills that you need of course! Don't just learn - actually apply what you think you know.

Answer the question: "If we hire you today, what can you do on Monday morning that will benefit us?". Your concrete skills answer this question.

**Action**  
Collect the CVs of people whose skills you respect. Identify five discrete skills noted on the CV and determine which of these skills would be immediately useful on the kind of team you want to join. Put together a plan and a toy project that will demonstrate that you have acquired these skills.

### Expose Your Ignorance

> Tomorrow I need to look stupider and feel better about it. This staying quiet and trying to guess what's going on isn't working so well.

**Problem**
You're being put on a job where people depend on you to deliver, but you don't know enough.

**Solution**  
Ask questions.

> I actually had grown attached to feeling ignorant on a daily basis; it let me know I was in the right place. I was growing. - Dave Hoover

**Action**  
Write down 5 things you really don't understand about your work. Put that list where others can see it. Refresh it as your work changes.

### Confront your Ignorance

Actively fill in the gaps in your knowledge from "Expose Your Ignorance".

### The Deep End

**Problem**  
Taking small, safe steps has left you unsatisfied. You need to grow your skills, confidence and portfolio of successful work.

**Solution**  
Jump into the deep end. Take on that promotion or foreign assignment when it's offered, even if failure is staring you in the face.

**Action**  
What's the biggest successful project you've worked on? What's the biggest codebase you have ever built on your own? Write down the answers to these questions, and see if you can find other dimensions of project complexity and other ways of measuring your projects. Build up a chart of all projects you've ever worked on.
