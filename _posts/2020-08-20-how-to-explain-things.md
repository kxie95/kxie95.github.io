You have just finished a long explanation of something that makes complete sense in your head.

*Everyone has blank looks on their faces.* 

You try to explain some more.

*More blank looks.*


Learning to explain things to people is an incredibly important skill, especially in the software industry. I'd say I probably spend at least 30% of my time at work either explaining ideas, problems or solutions. Therefore, I really want to spend my next "learning cycle" at work trying to get better at this skill. My aim is to make a mini workshop to try on my colleagues at the end. 

Here you can find all my reflections and ramblings on this quest to explaining things better.

## "Man, I really suck at explaining things" moments
In the past two weeks, I've had encounters with youth, and I tried to explain two different things.

1. I tried to explain some ticketing information. I said that certain tickets would be **"fully subsidised"**. 
My friend quickly jumped in after that to say "basically that means **it will be free**".
After that I was like, wow. Has my language really changed that much since I was in high school? Then I started to feel really old.

2. I tried to explain what an **actuator** was to a kid that was 15 years old.
This was a very on-the-spot situation so I quickly googled what an actuator was. Google's definition was *"a device that causes a machine or other device to operate"*. So I naively spat out that definition to the kid. That obviously meant nothing to them considering I'm giving them no context at all.

I realised two things upon reflecting on these two scenarios:
1. I need to use simpler language
2. I need to provide context and examples

## Reading takeaways

There is a highly rated book for explanation called "The Art of Explanation". I read through some notes of it I found on the internet (links at the bottom). Some key highlights I found (confirming the realisations I had above):

### Key components of a good explanation
- **Context**: The agreements and shared experiences we start with.
- **Story**: The big ideas of the narrative.
- **Connections**: Analogies and metaphors to connect the new concepts with what people already understand.
- **Descriptions**: Details and benefits.
- **Conclusion**: A summary of what was learned.

### Different ways to explain things & their pros/cons
Adapted from notes from thorprojects.com (see #4 in reading list).

1. Text

Pros:
- Quick
- With headings, easy to scan
- Easy to review and communicate details
- Easy to replicate


Cons:
- Harder to see higher level

2. Images

Pros:
- Easy to scan
- Good for communicating high level
- Easy to replicate

Cons:
- Takes a bit longer to make

3. Audio

Pros:
- Get more feelings from voice

Cons:
- Need audio equipment to reproduce
- Can't be scanned
- Hard to retain facts

4. Video

Pros:
- Combines audio, visual and text which can be more effective at communicating

Cons:
- Time consuming, requires equipment and skill
- Can't be scanned (though Google is changing this)

5. Live demonstration

Pros:
- Interactive: engages audience and allows you to adapt your message

Cons:
- Time consuming
- Only materials potentially scannable
- Hard to replicate - should be backed up with written material

## Challenges

Running experiments with the group I am learning with might be a good idea.

I want to try explaning different topics (of around the same complexity), containing the key components of a good explanation.
Each time I will use a different medium and see how well people understand me at the end.

I will probably only try text, visual and live demonstration.
