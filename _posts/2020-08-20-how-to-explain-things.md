You have just finished a long explanation of something that makes complete sense in your head.

*Everyone has blank looks on their faces.* 

You try to explain some more.

*More blank looks.*


Learning to explain things to people is an incredibly important skill, especially in the software industry. I'd say I probably spend at least 30% of my time at work either explaining ideas, problems or solutions. Therefore, I really want to spend my next "learning cycle" at work trying to get better at this skill. My aim is to make a mini workshop to try on my colleagues at the end. 

Here you can find all my reflections and ramblings on this quest to explaining things better.

## "Man, I really suck at explaining things" moments
In the past two weeks, I've had encounters with youth, and I tried to explain two different things.

1. I tried to explain some ticketing information. I said that certain tickets would be **"fully subsidised"**. 
My friend quickly jumped in after that to say "basically that means **it will be free**".
After that I was like, wow. Has my language really changed that much since I was in high school? Then I started to feel really old.

2. I tried to explain what an **actuator** was to a kid that was 15 years old.
This was a very on-the-spot situation so I quickly googled what an actuator was. Google's definition was *"a device that causes a machine or other device to operate"*. So I naively spat out that definition to the kid. That obviously meant nothing to them considering I'm giving them no context at all.

I realised two things upon reflecting on these two scenarios:
1. I need to use simpler language
2. I need to provide context and examples
