### Use an audience-focussed model

There are four key questions in the 4MAT model for structuring your presentation:

1.  _Why?_ - What is the context and rationale?
2.  _What?_ - What is the detail to be learned?
3.  _How?_ - How do I use and apply what I learn from this?
4.  _What if? What else?_ - Alternatives to what is presented so they can apply this new information in new contexts.

The order matters - you must first motivate the audience to listen, tell them about data and information, how they can apply it, and round off by covering the other bases.

This model can also be used in other contexts - meetings, impromptu explanations, interviews, emails, day-to-day conversations... the list goes on.
