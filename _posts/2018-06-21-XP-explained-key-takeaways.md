I can't say I read every single line of this book, because some parts were just boring. However, these are the points that resonated with me:  

## Listening is far more important than talking
I common problem I've faced while working with teams is that people are quick to throw out ideas, but are slow to listen to each other. I'm not sure what the problem is - for some it might be a pride issue, for others it may be that they just have to throw out their ideas before they forget. Still, if we had more people actively listening more than talking, my feeling is that we would have more effective teams where ideas are given the chance to cross-pollinate.

## Work as part of a whole, not as an individual
You may have an individual who is an expert at everything they do. They perform well all by themselves. When it comes to a team though, how a single person behaves is not nearly as important as how they behave as part of a team.   

## XP is really about people
It's not about the values and principles, it's just a mindset for people to help teams become more effective when working with one another. I read the values (Courage, Feedback, Simplicity, Communication, Respect) - and I feel like most of these are just a given (excluding Simplicity and Feedback) with any relationship, professional or not! I guess we are people though, we're not perfect and sometimes we forget these things. It's worth reiterating sometimes.
