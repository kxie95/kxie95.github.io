## Dynamics of Group Decision-making

Sam illustrates what a group dicussion usually looks like: [picture]

There's **divergent** and **convergent** thinking. Divergent thinking is the phase in the discussion when ideas are still being thrown around. Convergent thinking is when ideas come together and eventually a decision is made. In between is what he calls the **groan zone** - when it seems like ideas are just too different and it's hard to converge and decide on something.

## Participatory Decision-making core values

**Full Participation** - All members encouraged to speak up, whether it be about difficult issues or "first-draft" ideas.

**Mutual Understanding** - All members understand and accept each other's goals and needs. This allows them to think from their point of view.

**Inclusive Solutions** - Solutions that are a cross-pollination of different solutions to meet everyone's needs. These are not compromises.

**Shared Responsibility** - All members assume responsibility for a decision made by the group. There's no owning of a solution by a single person.

What I take from this is that we're not trying to find a "middle-ground" - we're trying to build on each other's ideas to get to a higher ground.

## The Role of a Facillitator

To encourage all the values above when in a group discussion. The facillitator's mission is to support everyone to do their best thinking.
