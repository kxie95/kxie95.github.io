* It's very hard to integrate Vue with an existing project. If someone knows how, please tell me.
* I used `vue init webpack` which gives you a fully configured project including linting, unit tests & e2e tests.
* I found the component system pretty straightforward.
* I like the concept of putting all related HTML, Javascript and CSS into one file related to a component.
* I wish vue-router would support scrolling to a specific section if a particular link is clicked.
* **I want to investigate more about the pros and cons of this vs ReactJS**.
