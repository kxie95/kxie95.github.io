summary:    "How my experience as a gradute at MYOB compares to my internship at Google."

In the two summers of my university degree, I interned at Google in Sydney, Australia. My experience there is one of the highlights of my career as a software developer. After all, who doesn't like a company who feeds you, allows you to nap during work and has funky spaces for you to play?  
  
Now you might be wondering why I would leave that for a smaller, less global company like MYOB. The truth is, I didn't. Google's interview processes are rigorous. Although my mentors responded positively at my performance during my internships, I didn't perform well enough in my final interviews for them to accept me. It was one of the toughest rejections I've faced, but it strengthened and motivated me. I definitely feel like I can handle most rejections now, and it also made me reflect on the gaps in my knowledge.  
  
I've always thought that no experience I'll have next could top the Google one. That was incredibly silly of me to think that way, because over the past year MYOB has really challenged and changed that thought of mine. MYOB has been continuously refining their graduate programme over the past year, and I can safely say that there are some things Google can learn from too. Of course, the reverse is true as well.  

Here are some comparisons between my internship at Google, and my graduate experience at MYOB:  

## Finding the right people
**Application Process**:  
**Google**: Online form screening and two technical interviews over Google Docs and phone.  
**MYOB**: Video screening, in-person group activities with other candidates, and non-technical interview(s).  

While I feel that Google does well in finding people who are technically strong, there isn't enough focus in finding candidates who are a great match value-wise and with good interpersonal skills. The only indicators of these were in the online application form, but not much was done to understand what I was like as a person and the values which matter most to me. I guess their bet was on being able to mould people into the culture at Google.

MYOB on the other hand focuses more on finding people who fit in value-wise, with not much focus on technical skill (apart from questions about past experiences on projects). Our thinking is that technical skill is easier train up whereas someone's values and passion are hard to change.  

## Onboarding & Setup
**Google**: Induction presentations about company, activities to get to know interns, introduced to mentors and planned lunch with the team. All crucial tools and software are needed are ready from the get-go.  
**MYOB**: Induction week to get to know the company, activities to get to know other graduates, team introductions is up to the team. Individual setup needed to get some tools and software ready for development.

As I write about the key points in my onboarding experiences, they seem kind of similar but in reality I found the Google onboarding experience to be more engaging, fun and streamlined. I liked how the whole experience felt very true to Google's culture, an innovative and fun place to work. They went over the company's vision and set up a lot of creative activities to help interns get to know each other. Small touches such balloons and candies on our desks, and a treasure hunt to get to know the office helped tie the experience altogether.  

A big thing that made my life easier while getting setup was Google's dedicated tech team. They were readily available and responsive at any time during the work day. Any small bits of hardware like USB cables, HDMI cables etc. were available in wracks around the office.

I was flown to MYOB's headquarters for my induction week. During this week, we listened to a lot of presentations from executive members and a few engineers. Most of getting to know people was through lunches. When I arrived back in the Auckland office, I started work just like every other employee. Overall, I enjoyed the induction. 

## Office Environment  
**Google**: Open office, kitchens with snacks and drinks, nap rooms, recreational rooms.  
**MYOB**: Open office, kitchens with refreshments, one recreational room.  
  
Google's office environment didn't feel like an office at all. The colourful decor helped reflect its branding and had many places where employees could relax, have fun or do something creative. All of the spaces were thoughtfully made. I could really tell that the company cares about having happy employees.    
  
MYOB's office layout is similar, with interesting decor around the office. The company is a lot smaller than Google, and so it does not have as much to pour out into extravagant rooms for entertainment, which is fair. I do think the company could benefit from a nap room though; I don't think we should all have to rely on coffee to feel awake. My opinion of course :).    

## Mentorship
**Google**: Two hosts for "STEP interns" (less experienced), one host for "SWE interns" (more experienced).  
**MYOB**: Originally started out with one mentor, but has now changed to two.

One main difference I observed was that the mentor(s) I had at Google were more hands-off than the ones MYOB. At the time, I didn't think much of it. Google has a much higher bar in terms of technical skill, so they could get away with being more hands-off. However, the result of this was that I didn't grow as much. I also wasn't able to get the full benefits of having a mentor. The only gaps in my knowledge I found were through code reviews, and nothing else. Mentors at Google want to get you to a place where you'll be hired full-time, but from what I could see the company didn't give enough support for mentors to help all mentees do that.

In contrast, at MYOB, I spent a lot of time pairing with my mentor(s) and mobbing with other people. I found this incredibly useful because I was able to see better ways of working and incorportated good habits in the way I code too. Code reviews are a great form of feedback, but it only tells you about the *result* of the code you produced and nothing about the *way* in which you produced that code. Pairing/mobbing with other people gives you that and more. 

After having tried a having a single mentor vs. co-mentors, I personally enjoy and see more benefits in having two mentors. There are a few reasons for this. If one mentor is busy, the other can cover and help the mentee. Having two mentors also gives you two perspectives, which is great for keeping the mentee's mind open to different ways of solving problems. 

## Programme structure
**Google**: Work on a project in one team for 3 months (the whole internship). Mandatory presentation done at the end.  
**MYOB**: Work with different teams in 3-6 month rotations for up to 2 years.  

Internships usually only last 3 months, so it makes sense to only work on one project for the whole internship. What I like is that they pick projects based on what you're interested in, and they find a team which they think would be a good fit for you. This is great; I had so much fun doing these projects! However, I feel I specialised a bit too early on in my career because of my love for Android development. In retrospect, it would have been better to expose myself to different programming paradigms to stretch my mind.

As MYOB's graduate programme is longer, we have the luxury of being able to rotate into different teams. This was an eye-opening experience for me. I've worked with 4 different teams now, and they were each diverse in their people, technologies and way of working. This does come with its downsides though; not all teams were a good fit for me. Still, I grew a lot from these experiences and am glad I went through it all. I learned more about how to communicate with people with different personalities. I learned and experimented with different agile mindsets. I learned better ways of coding. Most importantly, I learned more about how to work with people in spite of our differences. Some of those things I would not have as much exposure to if I were at Google.  

# TLDR  
* I had great experiences at both Google and MYOB.
* Google's strength lies in its culture of fun, creativity and eye for technically-strong engineers.  
* MYOB's strength lies in its openness to experiment and its focus on growing engineers with potential. This is how its graduate (now protege) programme has become much more refined than when I first started.
