In the two summers of my university degree, I interned at Google in Sydney, Australia. My experience there is one of the highlights of my 2 year career as a software developer. After all, who doesn't like a company who feeds you, allows you to nap during work and has funky spaces for you to play?  
  
Now you might be wondering why I would leave that for a smaller, less global company like MYOB. The truth is, I didn't. Google's interview processes are rigorous. Although my mentors responded positively at my performance during my internships, I didn't perform well enough in my final interviews for them to accept me. It was one of the toughest rejections I've faced, but it strengthened and motivated me. I definitely feel like I can handle most rejections now, and it also made me reflect on the gaps in my knowledge.  
  
I've always thought that no experience I'll have next could top the Google one. That was incredibly silly of me to think that way, because over the past year MYOB has really challenged and changed that thought of mine. MYOB has been continuously refining their graduate programme over the past year, and I can safely say that there are some things Google can learn from too. Of course, the reverse is true as well.  
  
Here are some comparisons between my internship at Google, and my graduate experience at MYOB:  

## Finding the right people
**Application Process**:  
**Google**: Online form screening and two technical interviews over Google Docs and phone.  
**MYOB**: Video screening, in-person group activities with other candidates, and non-technical interview(s).  

I feel that Google does well in finding people who are technically strong, but there isn't enough focus in finding candidates who are a great match value-wise. I have a feeling that their bet was on being able to mould people into the culture at Google.

MYOB on the other hand focuses more on finding people who fit in value-wise, with not much focus on technical skill (apart from questions about past experiences on projects). Our thinking is that technical skill is easier train up whereas someone's values are hard to change.
