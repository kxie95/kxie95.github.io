[Refactor](http://refactor.org.nz/about/) is a movement which encourages, supports and motivates women working in, or passionate about technology.  

Yesterday I attended one of their events and they had three incredibly inspirational speakers - Carolyn Luey from MYOB, Alexia Hilbertidou from GirlBoss and Meriko Borogove, previously from Apple.  

**These were my key takeaways from their talks:**  
* Try things which challenge you, even if you're not an expert at it.
* We should expose young women to STEM - a lot of them are not aware of this industry and the potential they may have in it!
* Relationships come first. In everything you do at work, do it with kindness, respect and curiosity.

I really resonated with the last point - the way Meriko articulated this was particularly inspirational. It made me realise that these are the qualities I treasure when working with people and especially leaders.
