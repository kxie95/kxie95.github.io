I am happy to announce to you, one of the few readers of my blog, that I have now finished my journey as a protege in MYOB's Future Makers Academy (FMA)! °˖✧◝(^▿^)◜✧˖° This is only the beginning of my journey as a software developer - I hope to be a committed, life-long learner.  

To not forget this amazing experience, I wanted to blog and reflect about it. Be prepared for a pretty long post. :)  

When I first started my job at MYOB, there was no FMA. We simply had a graduate programme where we were put into teams and expected to help deliver value to our customers. However, it lacked direction - I felt that I was neither growing as an engineer nor inspired as a person. My desire was to make cool software, but my day-to-day work didn't allow me to do that. It was quite a depressing time in my life where I questioned why I joined this company and profession.  

I told myself to stick it out for a few more months. I decided to put all my hopes into the next team I was going to join. After talking to some people, there was a bit of a buzz around a certain team in the office. I knew I wanted to be in a team like that. After all, if people are talking about how great they are, there must be something or someone inspiring there. So I decided to talk to their manager to ask to be a part of their team. The team agreed, so I joined them.
