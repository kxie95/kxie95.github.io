I am happy to announce to you, one of the few readers of my blog, that I have now finished my journey as a protege in MYOB's Future Makers Academy (FMA)! °˖✧◝(^▿^)◜✧˖° This is only the beginning of my journey as a software developer - I hope to continue to be a committed, life-long learner.  

To not forget this amazing experience, I wanted to blog and reflect about it. Be prepared for a pretty long post. :)  

## Early days
When I first started my job at MYOB, there was no FMA. We simply had a graduate programme where we were put into teams and expected to help deliver value to our customers. However, it lacked direction - I felt that I was neither growing as an engineer nor inspired as a person. My desire was to make cool software, but my day-to-day work didn't allow me to do that. It was quite a depressing time in my life where I questioned why I joined this company and profession.  

I told myself to stick it out for a few more months. I knew that I didn't  I decided to put all my hopes into the next team I was going to join - if that didn't work out then I was thinking of moving on. After talking to some people, there was a bit of a buzz around a certain team in the office. I knew I wanted to be in a team like that. After all, if people are talking about how great they are, there must be something or someone inspiring there. So I decided to talk to their manager to ask to be a part of their team. The team agreed, so I joined them.  

## My second team
My second team was incredibly different to my first team. They embraced mob programming, were collaborative and were extremely diverse as people. No team is perfect, and this one certainly wasn't an exception, but I was inspired by the team's openness to experimenting with new ways of working. I loved what was happening in this team.    

In the 6 months I was with this team, I learned far more than I did in my 6 months of internships during my university years. It boosted my technical skills by constantly pairing and mobbing with other engineers. I saw and learned different ways of working - for example, the different setups people use on their machines to boost their productivity, the process of how someone arrives at a solution, how people stay focused on the task at hand, etc. I liked that the team strived to be cross-functional which allowed me to learn all aspects of building software from analysis to development to devops.  

## The birth of the "Academy"
While I was having a great team experience, I felt there was something lacking in my learning and that there were still gaps in my knowledge. I wanted to know: How do I get better? How do I know I've become better? How can I make my learning specific and focused on a certain area? What should I learn? These were questions I raised with my manager at the time (who is now the driver of the FMA). We realised we needed a better plan to grow not only the more junior people in our company, but also the senior ones. It was around the same time that my manager had plans to spend time with 8th Light in order to gain insights into how to mentor and grow developers. This was the beginning of how FMA started.  
  
Soon after, my manager and a developer willingly put time and effort into starting what they called the "Academy". This was 2 hours a week spent reviewing code and learning foundational software skills. Topics covered included TDD, 4 rules of simple design, refactoring and composition, to list a few. While I had learned many of these in my years at university, it was mostly theory in my head which I didn't know how to apply. While I can't say I loved doing all the coding exercises (Come on, we got out of university to escape assignments!) that were given to me, I still found these sessions incredibly valuable and insightful. I'm so grateful for the time and effort put into these sessions.  

## The graduate team and meaningful project
After we'd all had some experience with different crews, the company wanted to experiment with forming a team of only graduates. As I had the most experience working with a system end-to-end, most of the architectural decisions were directed by me with the help of a technical advisor. I found this change of responsibility refreshing - I suppose this is what it's like for people with more experience in a team. I did more guiding and explaining compared to when I was in my other team, which I enjoyed and found a lot of value in. As I now had to ensure other people understood what I had in mind, this helped solidify gaps in my knowledge as well.

All in all, I feel the graduate team was a success. We had great team cohesion, our discussions were productive, development was fun and we ended up delivering a product that the customer was happy with. It's a huge shame we can't actually be a permanent team.  

## Choosing my home team
At the end of the Academy, you're expected to choose a team to join permanently. To be honest, I liked the experience of being able to speed date crews. I think we definitely have it better than other employees who get placed in teams and don't have much of a decision. They don't get to see as many parts of MYOB and how different crews operate.

Choosing a team was incredibly hard for me. My first choice would have been the crew formed with the other proteges, but that was not an option. I had to reorganise my thinking to decide. There were 3 things I valued:  
1. Team dynamics - do I like the way this team works? 
2. Ability to make an impact - Am I able to positively influence and add value to this team? How does this team affect the rest of the organisation?
3. Interest in domain - Do I like what I'm building?
