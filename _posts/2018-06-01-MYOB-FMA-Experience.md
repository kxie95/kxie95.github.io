I am happy to announce to you, one of the few readers of my blog, that I have now finished my journey as a protege in MYOB's Future Makers Academy (FMA)! °˖✧◝(^▿^)◜✧˖° This is only the beginning of my journey as a software developer - I hope to continue to be a committed, life-long learner.  

To not forget this amazing experience, I wanted to blog and reflect about it. Be prepared for a pretty long post. :)  

## Early days
When I first started my job at MYOB, there was no FMA. We simply had a graduate programme where we were put into teams and expected to help deliver value to our customers. However, it lacked direction - I felt that I was neither growing as an engineer nor inspired as a person. My desire was to make cool software, but my day-to-day work didn't allow me to do that. It was quite a depressing time in my life where I questioned why I joined this company and profession.  

I told myself to stick it out for a few more months. I decided to put all my hopes into the next team I was going to join - if that didn't work out then I was thinking of moving on. After talking to some people, there was a bit of a buzz around a certain team in the office. I knew I wanted to be in a team like that. After all, if people are talking about how great they are, there must be something or someone inspiring there. So I decided to talk to their manager to ask to be a part of their team. The team agreed, so I joined them.  

## My second team
My second team was incredibly different to my first team. They embraced mob programming, were collaborative and were extremely diverse as people. No team is perfect, and this one certainly wasn't an exception, but I was inspired by the team's openness to experimenting with new ways of working. I loved what was happening in this team.  

In the 6 months I was with this team, I learned far more than I did in my 6 months of internships during my university years. It boosted my technical skills by constantly pairing and mobbing with other engineers. I saw and learned different ways of working - these I wouldn't have learned if I were just working alone.  

## The birth of the "Academy"
While I was having a great team experience, I felt there was something lacking in my learning and that there were still gaps in my knowledge. I wanted to know: How do I get better? How do I know I've become better? How can I make my learning specific and focused on a certain area? What should I learn? These were questions I raised with my manager at the time (who is now the driver of the FMA). We realised we needed a better plan to grow not only the more junior people in our company, but also the senior ones. It was around the same time that my manager had plans to spend time with 8th Light in order to understand and gain insights into how to mentor and grow developers. This was the beginning of how FMA started.
