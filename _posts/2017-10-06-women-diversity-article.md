Eventually writing an article about this so I'm jotting down some notes now.  

When I first started:
* Immediately there was a difference in personalities I encountered
* The way people communicate are different
* I felt like I was overly sensitive all the time compared to other people
* I felt pressured to perform because I didn't want people to think I was hired because of my gender - I have received 
What helped me:
* Great leadership is really important - helps spread awareness
* Someone who you can talk to who can empathise - for me that's my sister
*
