Some preliminary notes on an article I will eventually write about my experiences as a woman in the software industry.   

**Everything I've written here is a brain dump (like the rest of my posts) and I have not had a look at other people's opinions yet.**  

### What is diversity? Why is it such a popular topic right now?
What I think it is: How many different backgrounds the workforce is made up of.  

Diversity in the technology/software industry is a popular topic right now because people have noticed that there is not a great representation of the human population working in this industry. Why is this important? As long as we hire the best programmers everything should be fine right?  

Some study (to find source) - a team of high performers vs. a team of diverse people from different backgrounds showed that the diverse team produced greater results. Not sure if true and I need to read up on the results of this and how they conducted this experiment.  

I believe we do need more diversity in the tech industry because having a workforce which is more representative of your customer base is incredibly valuable. If I hire people who only love to code and have no actual knowledge of who they're building their software for, how are they going to build software that their customers find useful? Then you might say, that's the BA's job right? Well now you're limiting the creativity of the design up to a few people - your BAs, UX designers and product managers. Imagine how much more awesome the product could be if everyone understood the customer or *is* the customer.    

I do not believe we should just hire the best programmers - this gives you a very narrow vision. They may be the best programmers at the time, but if they are not invested in the long run your company is going to go down. I believe we need to hire people based on their potential and passion for the industry.  

I'm not sure if we should be specifically hunting out females/other minorities in the industry though. We definitely should not lower the bar for them either. However, we should have things in place to make it so they will succeed and have fulfulling careers.  

If we want to bring more diversity into the industry, we need to start from an earlier age.  

We also have problems with retaining females in the industry.  

TODO: Have a look at books/articles.

### My experience starting as a female graduate in the tech industry:
Different personalities encountered
* I am quite a soft-spoken person, and I like listening and taking in what people say before I make comments. The reason is because I don't want to waste people's time with my thoughts which may not make much sense.  
* I have to fight to talk  

I felt like I was overly sensitive compared to other people  
* There was a time where I could not take the jokes which made me feel undervalued. Things such as "grads are cheap labour" and "grads are actually very expensive because a senior has to look after them" were thrown around and were things that made me feel upset. I don't believe the people who said these things had ill intentions, that's just the type of humour they enjoy. 
* You could argue that although the intention was not bad, people should still watch what they say. I agree and disagree - I agree because words can impact someone for life but I disagree because if we have to watch so closely the things we say, this can result in an uptight atmosphere. 
* In the end, it all comes down to the relationship - the closer you are with someone, the less you will need to watch your words because you are aware of their intent. As I was not close to any of these people, what they said I took word for word to heart.
* I never felt this way in my day to day life with other people. Then I realised the people I hang around all have similar mindsets so there is rarely any friction between us.  

I felt pressured to perform because I didn't want people to think I was hired because of my gender  
* A classmate once commented that I was only hired as an intern at Google because of my gender.  

I haven't experienced any direct form of sexism - I think in NZ it's much more subtle. Bigger issue is problem lack of awareness - people I have spoken to don't believe there are any problems because they don't see them. Caveat is they aren't in the same position as I or many other female engineers are in.

### What helped me:
Great leadership  
* Having a leader in the team who understands problems with diversity is helpful in that they have more power than you do as someone lower in the organisation. They can spread awareness faster than you can. Only applies to companies with a more hierarchical organisation.  

Someone who you can talk to who can empathise  
* Possibly a female in the industry who you feel comfortable talking to on a personal level - for me that's my sister
* It doesn't even have to be a female in the industry - it can just be someone who understands what you're going through.  

Focus on constant improvement
* Books which helped me improve my technical skills, think about where my career is headed and about how to learn.
* Pet project - thing to play around and experiment with things you couldn't do with a production system.
* Mentorship - Getting a someone who is a master/is better than you at a certain area to help you improve.
* Actions speak louder than words - cliche, but absolutely true.
