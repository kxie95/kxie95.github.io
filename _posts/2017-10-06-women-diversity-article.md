Some preliminary notes on an article I will eventually write about my experiences as a woman in the software industry.  

### What is diversity? Why is it such a popular topic right now?
What I think it is: How many different backgrounds the workforce is made up of.  

Diversity in the technology/software industry is a popular topic right now because people have noticed that there is not a great representation of the human population working in this industry. Why is this important? As long as we hire the best programmers everything should be fine right?  

Some study (to find source) - a team of high performers vs. a team of diverse people from different backgrounds showed that the diverse team produced greater results. Not sure if true and I need to read up on the results of this and how they conducted this experiment.  

I believe we do need more diversity in the tech industry because having a workforce which is more representative of your customer base is incredibly valuable. If I hire people who only love to code and have no actual knowledge of who they're building their software for, how are they going to build something that satisfies their customer? Then you might say, that's the BA's job right? Well now you're limiting the creativity of the design up to a few people - your BAs, UX designers and product managers. Imagine how much more awesome the product could be if everyone resonated with the customer?  

I do not believe we should just hire the best programmers - this gives you a very narrow vision. They may be the best programmers at the time, but if they are not invested in the long run your company is going to go down.  

I believe we need to hire people based on their potential and passion for the industry.  

I'm not sure if we should be specifically hunting out females/other minorities in the industry though. We definitely should not lower the bar for them either. However, we should have things in place to make it so they will succeed and have fulfulling careers.  

### My experience starting as a graduate in the tech industry:
Immediately there was a difference in personalities I encountered  

The way people communicate are different to me  

I felt like I was overly sensitive all the time compared to other people  
* I never felt this way in my day to day life with other people. Then I realised the people I hang around all have similar mindsets so there is rarely any friction between us.  

I felt pressured to perform because I didn't want people to think I was hired because of my gender  
* Someone once commented that I was only hired as an intern at Google because of my gender.  

### What helped me:
Great leadership  
* Having a leader in the team who understands problems with diversity is helpful in that they have more power than you do as someone lower in the organisation. They can spread awareness faster than you can. Only applies to companies with a more hierarchical organisation.  

Someone who you can talk to who can empathise  
* Possibly a female in the industry who you feel comfortable talking to on a personal level - for me that's my sister
* It doesn't even have to be a female in the industry - it can just be someone who understands what you're going through.
