Some preliminary notes on an article I will eventually write about my experiences as a woman in the software industry.   

**Everything I've written here is a brain dump (like the rest of my posts) and I have not had a look at other people's opinions yet.**  

### What is diversity in the context of the tech industry?
What I think it is: Having a range of different backgrounds (gender, culture, etc.) in the tech industry.  

### Why does it matter?
* As long as we hire the best programmers everything should be fine right?  
* Some study (to find source) - a team of high performers vs. a team of diverse people from different backgrounds showed that the diverse team produced greater results. Not sure if true and I need to read up on the results of this and how they conducted this experiment.  
* There is not a great representation of the human population working in this industry. 
* I believe we do need more diversity in the tech industry because having a workforce which is more representative of your customer base is incredibly valuable. If we hire people who only love to code and have no actual knowledge of who they're building their software for, how are they going to build software that their customers find useful? 
* That's the BA's job right? Well now we're limiting the creativity of the design up to a few people; to our BAs, UX designers and product managers. Imagine how much more awesome the product could be if everyone understood the customer or *is* the customer.
* Getting people from different backgrounds drives creativity and can result in a better solution in the long run.    

### How should we do it?
* Hire based on potential and passion for the industry.  
* We shouldn't be specifically hunting out females/other minorities for the industry. We should not be poaching from other companies either because that doesn't increase the population of the minorities in the industry.
* We definitely should not lower the bar for them either. 
* We should increase retention - I remember reading some article about how women were leaving the engineering industry within X number of years. (TODO: find source)
* We need to start from an earlier age - part of the problem is ingrained within our culture. Possibly the hobbies we encourage, or the mannerisms we expect women to have.
* We need ways to help it thrive. With diversity there can be a lot more friction because of the different mindsets. Need a safe environment where people can rub ideas off on each other.

TODO: Have a look at books/articles.

### My experience starting as a female graduate in the tech industry:
I don't believe I have experienced any direct form of sexism, but a very subtle form of it.
* It's hard to tell whether it's my age, personality, or actually just my gender. So many factors play into it.
* I know my female friends in other industries have experienced not being taken as seriously because of their gender.   

I felt like I was overly sensitive compared to other people.  
* There was a time where I could not take the jokes which made me feel undervalued. Things such as "grads are cheap labour" and "grads are actually very expensive because a senior has to look after them" were thrown around and were things that made me feel upset. I don't believe the people who said these things had ill intentions, that's just the type of humour they enjoy. 
* You could argue that although the intention was not bad, people should still watch what they say. I agree and disagree - I agree because words can impact someone for life but I disagree because if we have to watch so closely the things we say, this can result in an uptight atmosphere. 
* In the end, it all comes down to the relationship - the closer you are with someone, the less you will need to watch your words because you are aware of their intent. As I was not close to any of these people, what they said I took word for word to heart.
* I never felt this way in my day to day life with other people. Then I realised the people I hang around all have similar mindsets so there is rarely any friction between us.  

I felt pressured to perform because I didn't want people to think I was hired because of my gender. 
* A classmate once commented that I was only hired as an intern at Google because of my gender.  

Lack of awareness of this issue
* People I have spoken to don't believe there are any problems because they don't see them. Caveat is they aren't in the same position as I or many other female engineers are in.
* It's almost like an invisible illness.

### What helped me:
Great leadership.
* Having a leader in the team who understands problems with diversity is helpful in that they have more power than you do as someone lower in the organisation. They can spread awareness faster than you can. Only applies to companies with a more hierarchical organisation.  

Someone who you can talk to who can empathise.  
* Possibly a female in the industry who you feel comfortable talking to on a personal level - for me that's my sister
* It doesn't even have to be a female in the industry - it can just be someone who understands what you're going through.  

Focus on constant improvement.
* Books which helped me improve my technical skills, think about where my career is headed and about how to learn.
* Pet project - thing to play around and experiment with things you couldn't do with a production system.
* Mentorship - Getting a someone who is a master/is better than you at a certain area to help you improve.
* Actions speak louder than words - cliche, but absolutely true.
