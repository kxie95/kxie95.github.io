* To write clean code, you must first write dirty code *and then clean it*.
* Feature Envy: Methods of a class should be interested in the variable and functions of the class they belong to, and not the variables and functions of other classes.
* Put code in places that is intuitive to readers.
* Refactor your function so that it is so clean and expressive that it's obvious how it works.
