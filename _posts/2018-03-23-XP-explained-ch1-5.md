## Chapter 1 - What is XP?
XP is about social change.  
* Learning to get rid of things which hold us back from being productive.
* Doing the best that we can with what we have control over.

**Thoughts**  
I didn't expect that first line to be about social change. I've always thought XP to be a list of things to follow that will make your team awesome. I like the way Kent frames it though; it's not some process to follow, it's about values and mindsets to have which will help you and your software team be more productive.

## Chapter 2 - Learning to Drive
Stay aware. Adapt. Change.  
* We need to do this because everything in software changes - requirements, people, business, design, etc.
* Think about whether each practice your team adds improves effectiveness, communication, confidence and/or productivity.

## Chapter 3 - Practices, Values and Principles
* Values: things we like and don't like.
* Principles: bridges values and practices; they are domain-specific guidelines.
* Practices: things we do that are the evidence of our values.

## Chapter 4 - XP Values
> The biggest problem I encounter in what people "just know" about software development is that they are focused on individual action. What    actually matters is not how any given person behaves as much as how the individuals behave as part of a team and as part of an organisation.  

XP embraces 5 values to guide development:  
1. Communication: Our problems can be solved faster if we share our knowledge.
2. Simplicity: Do the simpliest thing that could possibly work. Reduces the amount you need to communicate about.
3. Feedback: Change is inevitable therefore there is need for feedback.
4. Courage: Effective action in the face of fear.
5. Respect: Everyone should care for and be treated as equally important.

These values must be embraced together, not independently. For example, you can't just focus on feedback while having no respect for the people you work with, courage helps in giving feedback and communication, etc.

## Chapter 5 - Principles
Values are too abstract to guide behaviour so we have these principles:  

**Humanity**  
Software is a people thing. People need safety, accomplishment, belonging, growth and intimacy.  

**Economics**
The software we build must have some sort of business value.  

**Mutual Benefit**
Every activity should benefit all concerned. **[most important one]**  

**Self-Similarity**  
[I don't really get this one - I think it's something about how some things can be applied to many places.]  

**Improvement**  
Do the best you can today. Put improvement to work by not waiting for perfection.  

**Diversity**  
There will inevitably be conflicts with diverse team members. All opinions should be valued and need conflicts need to be resolved productively.  

**Reflection**  
Good teams don't just do their work, they think about how they are working and why they are working.  

**Flow**  
Deliver things in small chunks.

**Opportunity**  
Consciously choose to transform each problem into an opportunity.  

**Redundancy**  
Making sure there is a backup if other solutions fail, but not to the point where it is wasteful.

**Failure**  
If you're having trouble succeeding, fail. Failure is not a waste if it imparts knowledge.

**Quality**  
Do work you are proud of.

**Baby steps**  
Taking small steps to get to a bigger goal feels safer than doing one massive change.  

**Accepted Responsibility**
Responsibility cannot be assigned, only accepted.
