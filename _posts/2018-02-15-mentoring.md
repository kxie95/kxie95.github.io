> As a mentor, you should be steering your mentee towards a better place than where you are at. 

In the past few months, I've started mentoring but I still feel like I have a long way to go to becoming an effective mentor. So I started thinking about what I would like as my ideal mentor, and these came to mind:  

### Approachable
Relationships come first. I want a mentor I feel comfortable around so I feel safe asking them for advice. They need to be a person who likes to give help; they shouldn't be reluctant or unable to make themselves available. A bonus for me is if we can get along on a personal level too (as with all people I work with), but this is not absolutely necessary. 

### Honest, but kind
We all need someone who can give us a realistic view of where we're at and where we can improve. I don't want a mentor who butters everything up for me, but I do think it's important to communicate their feedback with grace. The other side to this is that I need to accept the feedback (given it is reasonable) and not see it as an attack, but a way to improve.  

### Knows how to teach
My mentor should know how I learn best (I should communicate that to them) and be able to adapt their teaching style to that.

### Is a proactive learner
My mentor should be someone who strives to improve themselves and their craft.
