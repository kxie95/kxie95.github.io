#### First try
* Docker is a thing that lets you build and run containers.
* Containers are useful - they're like lightweight VMs which have the libraries and/or programs you need to run or build your app code.
* Docker compose uses your compose file to configure and use multiple containers which may communicate with each other if needed.
* Made `Dockerfile` and defined and image with a working directory.
* You can pull down pre-made images from **Dockerhub** which is like a Github for containers.
* **Problem**: Generated files don't get persisted between each `docker run`.  

#### Second try  
![Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/images/types-of-mounts-volume.png)  

* Found out about the concept of `volumes`, which maps a folder in your container to a directory in your host.
* Made a `docker-compose.yml` to specify a volume. 
* Mapped current working directory of the host to a folder named app using `volumes: -.:/app`.
* Use `docker-compose run [name of container in yml] [command]` to run the container you want.
* Difference between `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose` is that a `Dockerfile` actually builds an image, whereas a docker-compose only contains the runnable binary you need to get it up and running. 
* So I think `Dockerfile` should be used if you're configuring the inner workings of an individual container, whereas if you're trying to get containers to communicate with other things or work together with other containers, use a `docker-compose.yml`.
