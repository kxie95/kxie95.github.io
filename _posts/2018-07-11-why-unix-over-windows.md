Random things I've encountered which annoy me, prompting me to switch over to a Mac at work.

### Line endings can screw up your bash scripts

I've had several times on my machine/another fellow Windows user's machine fail a build because there were those invisible /r/n line endings added to our scripts.

### Paths

### Better docker experience

I don't know why but I guess it's to do with docker using linux kernel features under the hood. If someone knows how to get Docker working well on Windows, please tell me!

### Nicer terminal

- Up arrow for arguments of commands!
- Although I do understand that there is a bash terminal for Windows now. I haven't tried this out yet so I don't know how this actually compares to iTerm + zsh.
