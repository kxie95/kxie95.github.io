Some people may think I've gone crazy, taking a break from my full-time job as a software engineer. Some people wonder why.

I thought I would write this post both to reassure myself and for those people who are wondering.

## How it all started
I started considering this only around 2 months ago, when I no longer felt satisfied with my full-time job. I felt I had kind of plateau'd in terms of learning, a lot of the people I respected had left and management wasn't in good shape.

Originally I wanted to leave sooner, but I genuinely heard God tell me to stay, so I did. I decided to ask him again and this time it was time to go. I also heard him tell me that I should help out more with the youth evangelistic movement I'm working with right now. 

I know what you're thinking - how can you base your career decisions off hearing some mystical being? 

It scares me too, but the God I know has plans to prosper me and not to harm me. He has the best for me in mind, even if I may not see it now. To be honest, helping out more with the youth movement I'm working with was not at the top of my list. I wanted to just jump into another job, get my nice salary, have work that is meaningful and call it a day.

However, when I got the contract in my hands, I felt so troubled. It's really hard to explain. On paper, this contract fulfilled all that I desired but I still felt really troubled. I believe that to be the Holy Spirit telling me that this was not the path I am supposed to take. 

Of course, I wanted more confirmation. So I prayed as I walked around in a park. He was telling me to remember who he is - he's the creator of the heavens and the earth. "Look at all the huge trees I made. If I can do this, I can also provide for you if that's what you're concerned about". 

He also showed me that work is an idol in my life. I've made it part of my identity and I place a lot of my value and worth based on what I do. Of course, that wasn't enough. I wanted more confirmation. And he gave me just that. 

Written on the inside cover of my journal was a verse from Isaiah 30:21:

*Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.”*

And v22, the part after it, really got me:

*Then you will desecrate your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, “Away with you!”*

Wow. I didn't need more confirmation than that.

## What have I been doing?
I took a good month long break.

The first 2 weeks was anxiety. Anxiety about not doing any work. Feeling useless and worthless. It took my a while to get rid of that feeling through talking to God, but I think that's what I needed. This period of time really helped detach my sense of self-worth from my job. 

The next 2 weeks was just resting. It was great! This is something that is so neglected in our society - people slave away for years just to pay off their mortgage (if they're fortunate enough to have one in this crazy housing crisis). 

Honestly, you don't even know if you'll live until tomorrow. So why put so much energy to pay off the loan quicker? Put your energy into something with purpose, and pay off whatever you need to pay off while you're at it. No need to rush.

## Now what?
I'm currently doing a mix of RICE movement and church work. It's been really interesting because I have so much flexibility in my time. It's also given me the space to take time and love my parents better by spending quality time with them. I hardly got to do that before.

## Future plans
I want to go overseas at some point. It's always been on my heart to share the good news of Jesus Christ with people overseas. Of course right now, it's to share it with where I'm living. But there is such a need in nations where there are few churches.

## Closing thoughts
This whole experience was a rollercoaster for me, but I know God is doing something in both my husband and me during this time. I've noticed we've grown a lot closer through this. I'm also learning to trust God a whole lot more which was what I prayed this year would be about for me. 

Another half year to go - let's see what adventures await. :)
