### What went well
* I got my message through - people said that it was good so I know they at least understood what I was saying!  

### What I could do better for next time
* Pace - I definitely felt myself talking faster.
* Voice - Clarity in my voice was lacking due to nervousness (my whole stomach was turning inside out). 

I'm sure there are plenty more things I could improve on but I will focus on these ones :).
