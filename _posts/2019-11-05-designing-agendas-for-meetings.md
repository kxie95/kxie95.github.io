## Seven types of meeting goals

- Share information: Announcement, report or presentation.
- Advance the thinking: Make progress on a topic on a step or task.
- Improve communication: Strengthen working relationships by sharing feelings.
- Build community: Boost morale and bonds between people. Eg. celebrations.
- Build capacity: Focus on developing skills.
- Make decisions: Address issue and bring it to a closure.
- Obtain input: Feedback only without any decisions being made.

Sometimes, the goal isn't to come to a decision. In the past, I've always felt that if I walked out of a meeting without any decision being made, it was a waste of time. This definitely isn't the case, especially with meetings I have with my current crew like stand-up, where the goal is not only to make decisions but also to share information.
