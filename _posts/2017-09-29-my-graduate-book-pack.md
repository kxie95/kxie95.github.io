As a graduate developer at MYOB, I was given these books to help aid my learning and passion in this field.
I have, so far, found all these books valuable and would recommend any person who is new to the software/tech field
to read these.  

#### Passionate Programmer
* Touches more on the soft skills and how to cultivate your passion as a software engineer.
* Makes you ask yourself why you do your job.

#### New Programmer's Survival Manual
* Touches on vital programming concepts and principles that are applicable no matter which job you're at.
* Also talks about important skills for any code base you work with. eg. making sure your code can take a beating, designing with tests, etc.
* Separates skills into early, mid and late career/novice, intermediate and master.
* Coding examples mainly in Ruby and C++. Good for exposure to other languages apart from your typical OO languages.

#### Apprenticeship Patterns
* Mainly about how to learn and navigate through your career.
* Long road stuff.
