Intro stuff
* Sunk cost effect - already invested so much, don't wanna get out
* Norman: Project retrospectives
* Postmortems don't add any benefit to the person it was done on - are our post mortems like this?
* Retros - thinking. stop. learn. who cares who fault it was.*
* What retros aren't - not blaming, we need to believe that everyone did the best they could.
* We don't have any proof that Agile works, but we believe in it.
* Tuning - little adjustments, do it often. This is how our retrospectives should be like.
* Theory of mind - we can think about what others are thinking.
* Come up with an action plan as a result of our retro.  

Things we're doing wrong
* We sit too much - we need to move.
* Get enough sleep or you won't learn.
* Get natural light.
* Everything has to be done in a short time frame and we don't work well that way.  

Interesting thing to try
* Real-time timeline - People post ideas and events as they happen. I would really love to try this idea.
* I think even weekly retros aren't regular enough. I find it hard remembering what happened 5 hours ago.  

Your brain
* Unconscious: huge store of information
* Conscious: forgetful, in the moment
* Filters in our brain filter out things which don't fit with the things we know.
* Only way to avoid confimation bias is to be around people who don't agree with you.  

End
* Retros at different levels - short and long term ones
