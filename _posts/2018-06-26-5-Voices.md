5 Voices presents their view of the different "voices" or personalities in a team. These are:  
* __Pioneer__: Loud and communicates opinions with logic, rationality and force.
* __Connector__: Charismatic. Knows where to find sources and utilises relationships.
* __Guardian__: Preserves and protects. Analytical and detailed. Committed.
* __Nurturer__: Puts relationships and respect first. Wants everybody's voice to be heard.
* __Creative__: Future-oriented. Never satisfied with the status quo.

Of course no one is one personality/voice; everyone just has one which comes naturally to them. I don't disagree with the voices they present. I have definitely seen these in the teams I've worked with and with myself.
  
One thing I was a little disappointed in was that there wasn't anything about how say, a Nurturer, might interact more effectively with a Pioneer. I give this example because I feel I tend towards being a Nurturer and I sometimes struggle to communicate with Pioneers.
  
Overall, I didn't find this book too useful because I am well aware of these different voices. It was just interesting to see a different framework for it.
