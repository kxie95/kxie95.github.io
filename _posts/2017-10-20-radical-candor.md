### Ruinous empathy
* Being too nice and not telling people what they need to do to improve
* This is bad - speaker ended up having to hire a nice person who was not performing

### What can we do to reach radical candor?
* Make backstabbing impossible  
* Did you talk to blah about this?
* Send notes to manager at the end of the meeting
* Take care of yourself first
