## Chapter 1 - What is XP?
XP is about social change.  
* Learning to get rid of things which hold us back from being productive.
* Doing the best that we can with what we have control over.

### Thoughts
I didn't expect that first line to be about social change. I've always thought XP to be a list of things to follow that will make your team awesome. I like the way Kent frames it though; it's not some process to follow, it's about values and mindsets to have which will help you and your software team be more productive.

## Chapter 2 - Learning to Drive
Stay aware. Adapt. Change.  
* We need to do this because everything in software changes - requirements, people, business, design, etc.
* Think about whether each practice your team adds improves effectiveness, communication, confidence and/or productivity.

## Chapter 3 - Values
> The biggest problem I encounter in what people "just know" about software development is that they are focused on individual action. What actually matters is not how any given person behaves as much as how the individuals behave as part of a team and as part of an organisation.  

XP embraces 5 values to guide development:  
1. Communication: Our problems can be solved faster if we share our knowledge.
2. Simplicity: Do the simpliest thing that could possibly work. Reduces the amount you need to communicate about.
3. Feedback: Change is inevitable therefore there is need for feedback.
4. Courage: Effective action in the face of fear.
5. Respect
