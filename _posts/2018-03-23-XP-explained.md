## Chapter 1 - What is XP?
XP is about social change.  
* Learning to get rid of things which hold us back from being productive.
* Doing the best that we can with what we have control over.

### Thoughts
I didn't expect that first line to be about social change. I've always thought XP to be some sort of methodology like Scrum. I like the way Kent frames it though; it's not some process to follow, it's about values and mindsets to have which will help you and your software team be more productive.

## Chapter 2 - Learning to Drive
Stay aware. Adapt. Change.  
* We need to do this because everything in software changes - requirements, people, business, design, etc.
* Think to self about improving effectiveness communication confidence and productivity.
