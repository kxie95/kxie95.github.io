## Introduction
Feedback is crucial: It improves performance, develops talent, aligns expectiations,... etc. But feedback is hard and doesn't work in many organisations.

We can improve the way we receive feedback to:
- Identify and manage the emotions triggered by the feedback
- Extract value from criticism even when it's poorly delivered

## Why feedback doesn't register
Feedback hits at two core human needs:
1. The need to learn and grow
2. The need to be accepted just the way you are

This is what makes receiving feedback hard. Feedback causes a tension between the two.

We have three different triggers when it comes to feedback:
1. **Truth triggers**: Set off by the content of the feedback, when it seems unhelpful or untrue, you feel wronged and exasperated.
2. **Relationship triggers**: Tripped off by the person providing the feedback. Exchanges are coloured by what you believe about the giver (eg. their credibility, how you feel about your previous interactions with them).
3. **Identity triggers**: You relationship with yourself. Whether the feedback is right or wrong, wise or witless, it can be devastating if it causes your sense of who you are to come undone. In such moments youâ€™ll struggle with feeling overwhelmed, defensive, or off balance.

These are natural and reasonable, but we do want to be able to:
- **Recognise what's happening** and 
- Learn **how to derive benefit from feedback** even if it sets off your triggers.

## 6 steps to becoming a better receiver
1. **Know your tendencies**
- What are the patterns in how you respond? (defend yourself on facts, argue about the method of delivery, strike back, etc.)
- Does time make a difference? (do you reject immediately and reconsider over time, accept immediately and later decide it's not valid, etc.)

2. **Separate the "what" from the "who"**
- If the feedback is on target/wise, it shouldn't matter who delivers it, but it does.
- Rich conversations happen when you set aside snap judgements and explore where the feedback is coming from.

3. **Sort toward coaching**
- There is **evaluative** (you're an 8/10) and **coaching** (here's how you can improve) feedback.
- Work towards hearing feedback as potentially valuable advice from a fresh perspective (not accusatory)

4. **Unpack the feedback**
- Often it's not immediately clear whether feedback is valid and useful. Be sure to analyse it. For example:
> "Be more assertive" 
- What kind of observations and judgements were made to prompt this feedback?
- What did the giver expect? 
- What are they worried about?

5. **Ask for just one thing**
- Request feedback and direct it - this will less likely trigger you

6. **Engage in small experiments**
- When someone gives you advice, test it and see if it works.
- If it does, great. It it doesn't, tweak it and try again or just end the experiment.
