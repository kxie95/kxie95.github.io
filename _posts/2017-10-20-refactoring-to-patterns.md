### Intro
* Lots of wisdom in studying the evolution of a software system rather than its end state.
* Patterns are where you want to be, refactorings are ways to get there. - Martin Fowler  
My comments:  
* I don't see a lot of patterns in our code base. Am I just not recognising them or are patterns not used much?
* I learned about patterns at university but hardly ever applied any. Only one I used was Singleton and that tends to be abused.
