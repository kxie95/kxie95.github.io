### Intro
* Lots of wisdom in studying the evolution of a software system rather than its end state.
* Patterns are where you want to be, refactorings are ways to get there. - Martin Fowler  
My comments:  
* I don't see a lot of patterns in our code base. Am I just not recognising them or are patterns not used much?
* I learned about patterns at university but hardly ever applied any. Only one I used was Singleton and that tends to be abused. 

### Refactoring
* Behaviour preserving
* Business priorities and refactoring must be balanced  
Why refactor?
* Easier to add code
* Improve the design
* Gain better understanding
* Make code less annnoying  
Need many eyes to make things better.  

Design debt occurs when you don't consistently:
1. Remove duplication
2. Simplify your code
3. Clarify your code's intent
