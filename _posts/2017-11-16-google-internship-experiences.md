Will be doing a brown bag on this.   

Intro - outline the talk
* Going to be more about the culture and mentorship over the technical stuff.  

Interview process
* 1 phone screening, 2 technical interviews. Strong focus on algorithms.  

Onboarding - extremely smooth  
* All tech gear set up, very easy access to things you need. No problems with admin access.  

Office space
* Meeting rooms with awesome themes
* Many areas like our booths where you can work alone in peace and quiet
* Spaces for making stuff - had a 3D printer and other things you would find in a workshop.
* Fun is at every corner of the office, and there are large bright windows.

Internship
* Worked on real projects
* Supervision by an engineer (called a "host") with at least 3 years of experience at Google. Your go-to person for everything.  
* Hosts were not told to actively mentor the interns - interns would have to take charge of that themselves. This can be good or bad.
* As a STEP intern, you work in pairs. Talk about the pros and cons of this.

Culture
* Many tech talks and events to go to and there is no obligation to tell your manager about it.
* Not much pairing or mobbing - work is very individual but people are very open to asking around.
* Games everywhere. I still don't know how I got stuff done.
* Everyone was very friendly and I think this is the contagious culture of Googliness.
* Fun things: TotT, TGIFs, intern-host events, free swag, giant learning library.

Processes
* Extremely streamlined - so easy to book meeting rooms, present things on the screen.  

* Optionally talk about interviewing for a full-time role. Super tough - systems design interviews, algorithms, technolgies.
