I moved into a team with just graduates and interns about 1 month ago. The dynamic is extremely different to my previous team.  

* Have to take charge and make technical decisions that I otherwise wouldn't have in my previous team.
* In my old team, we tended to have a wider range of perspectives which made it take longer to come to a decision.
* I feel like the gaps in my knowledge are being filled in and solidified as I explain concepts to my team members.
